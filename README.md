## Summary:
this library uses RSS requests, which is easier to use than google search engine API.

google still doesn't like it if a computer is spam requesting RSS; if you spam it too much with scripts, your ip will be blacklisted.

### Recommendations to upgrade in the near future:

-use a proxy (this can hide your ip so you can make more requests. this can be done with some lines of code, or some kind of virtual environment)

-use a rotating list of proxies


### Recommendations to upgrade in the distant future:

-replace google RSS requests with scraping directly from news websites (dozens or hundreds of websites).

-maintain your own database to store results
